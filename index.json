Can be set between 0 seconds to 12 hours Can be set a Queue level or dynamically changed per message Caution: When using FIFO make sure to use Message GroupId which provides high distribution to avoid blocking processing due to error Note: For Standard queues, the visibility timeout isn\u0026#39;t a guarantee against receiving a message twice.

Lambda increases the number of processes that reads batches by up to 60 more instances per minute. The max no. of batches that an Event Source Mapping can process simultaneously is 1,000. FIFO queues: Lambda sends messages to your function in the order that it receives them and ensures that messages in the same group are delivered to Lambda in order. Lambda sorts the messages into groups and sends only one batch at a time for a group. Your function can scale in concurrency to the number of active message groups.
