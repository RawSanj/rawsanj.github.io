It would be cool if we can have the same Filter like feature for AWS Lambdas.\nIn this post, we will look at how to create a simple Java framework which adds the ability to intercept AWS Lambda requests just like conventions used by Servlet Filters.\nLearning from Spring Boot, we\u0026rsquo;ll follow convention over configuration and we will make this framework easy to use and reduce boiler-plate code. So we will create an interface Filter similar to javax.servlet.Filter except it accepts APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent and APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent instead of ServletRequest and ServletResponse respectively.\nWe will also create @FunctionFilter annotation to annotate the Filter classes so that the framework automatically detects it by reading the classes marked @FunctionFilter and applies it in the Order specified by the order attribute.\nTaking inspiration from Micronaut, one of the coolest and fastest growing frameworks for creating micro-services and serverless functions, to make things interesting we\u0026rsquo;ll use Annotation Processor to reduce the use of reflection. Although it might not add any significant benefit in our case since this is a small and simple framework, but it would help understand AOT (Ahead of Time Compilation) and set a path towards the adoption of matured feature-rich framework like Micronaut for serverless workloads where the cold start is a big concern.\nBefore we start, do read this introductory blog on Annotation Processor.\nWe can then write lambda functions with filter with easy - see below example:\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start by creating the @FunctionFilter annotation targeting class only and provide the default value of 0 to the order attribute. The order attribute will define the order in which the Filters are applied.\n@Target(ElementType.TYPE) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS) public @interface FunctionFilter { int order() default 0; }  Define the Filter interface with AWS API Gateway Proxy events as request and response:\npublic interface Filter { void doFilter(APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent request, APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent response, FilterChain chain); }  ","date":1556391496,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556391496,"objectID":"a02ef81c8bbb7b745d3aa8b05a0e2158","permalink":"https://rawsanj.dev/post/aws-lambda-filter-chain/","publishdate":"2019-04-28T00:28:16+05:30","relpermalink":"/post/aws-lambda-filter-chain/","section":"post","summary":"Filter Chain for Lambda with minimal Reflection","tags":["aws","lambda","java","annotation processing","reflection"],"title":"Aws Lambda Filter Chain","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Multi-instance WebSocket messaging demo using Spring Boot and Redis Pub/Sub Scalable Spring Boot Chat Application to demonstrate use of [Redis] - [Pub/Sub] for [WebSocket using STOMP] protocol, without using any external Message Broker like RabbitMQ to sync messages between different instances.\nDeploy to [Play with Docker] Ctrl + Click the below button to deploy multiple instances of the spring-redis-websocket load balanced by NGINX:\n\nInstallation and Configuration Pre-requisite: Install and run [Redis] locally or on Docker.\nTo run Redis in Docker:\n$ docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -e REDIS_PASSWORD=SuperSecretRedisPassword bitnami/redis  Clone repo: $ git clone https://github.com/RawSanj/spring-redis-websocket.git  Build and Run the applications: Build and run the spring-redis-websocket application:\n$ cd spring-redis-websocket $ mvn clean package $ mvn spring-boot:run  Run in Docker Build and run the spring-redis-websocket locally in Docker: Build the JAR file:\n$ mvn clean package  Build docker image:\n$ mvn docker:build  Run docker image:\n$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \\ $ rawsanj/spring-redis-websocket  Run multiple instance using docker-compose locally Run multiple instances of spring-redis-websocket locally load balanced via Ngnix connected to redis container in Docker:\n$ cd src/main/docker $ docker-compose up  Run in Kubernetes Assuming you have a Kubernetes Cluster up and running locally: $ kubectl apply -f src/main/k8s  ","date":1552851570,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552851570,"objectID":"59bd0c63c6463d2e3d8e6277161e5eba","permalink":"https://rawsanj.dev/project/spring-redis-websocket/","publishdate":"2019-03-18T01:09:30+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/spring-redis-websocket/","section":"project","summary":"Multi-instance WebSocket messaging Chat App demo using Spring Boot and Redis Pub/Sub","tags":["spring-boot","redis","websocket","spring-data-redis","pub-sub","docker","docker-compose","kubernetes","ngnix","java"],"title":"Spring Redis Websocket","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Spring Cloud Task Application running as CronJob in Kubernetes A Spring Cloud Task Application which runs as CronJob in Kubernetes every minute to fetch BitCoin rates, saves the rates in Mysql and notifies Users if/when the threshold is reached.\nInstallation and Configuration Pre-requisite: MySql Server is up and running and application is configured the MySql credentials\nClone repo: $ git clone https://github.com/RawSanj/spring-cloud-task-as-k8s-cronjob.git  Build and Run the applications: Build and run the spring-cloud-task-as-k8s-cronjob application:\n$ cd spring-cloud-task-as-k8s-cronjob $ mvn clean package $ mvn spring-boot:run  Run in Kubernetes Assuming you have a Kubernetes Cluster up and running and kubectl is configured, run: $ kubectl apply -f src/main/k8s  Or try Play with Kubernetes to quickly setup a K8S cluster:  Follow the instructions to create Kubernetes cluster.
